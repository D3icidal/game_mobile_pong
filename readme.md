#Pong Mobile

Pong Mobile is a node.js, html5 canvas, and websocket project to practice interaction with phone browsers and server side rendering - lag free.

## Visuals and Ideas
Game visuals will be based on my breakout game which uses HTML5 Canvas with geometric shapes rendered live with a neon glow effect.

## Mobile interaction
Phones will be used as a controller to raise/lower the paddles, and tapping the phone will shoot a ball/bullet (in future update)

## Tools
Node.js – To serve our app
Express – Web App Framework for Node.js
Socket.io – To create the websocket connection between our browser and phone
HTML5 Canvas - To render the game
