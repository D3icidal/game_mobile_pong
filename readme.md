#Pong Mobile

Pong Mobile is a node.js, html5 canvas, and websocket project to practice interaction with phone browsers and server side rendering - lag free.

## Visuals and Ideas
Game visuals will be based on my breakout game which uses HTML5 Canvas with geometric shapes rendered live with a neon glow effect.

## Mobile interaction
Phones will be used as a controller to raise/lower the paddles, and tapping the phone will shoot a ball/bullet (in future update)
